üîπ 1. CodeCommit Example

When your build is triggered from a branch:

```
echo $CODEBUILD_RESOLVED_SOURCE_VERSION
echo $CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION
```

In CodeBuild, you can get the branch name from CodeCommit builds, 
but it‚Äôs a little tricky because CodeBuild doesn‚Äôt inject a direct $BRANCH variable.

```
BRANCH_NAME=$(echo $CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION | sed 's|refs/heads/||')
echo "Branch = $BRANCH_NAME"
```

Got it üëç That happens because in CodePipeline ‚Üí CodeBuild integrations, 
the CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION you see is often an S3 object ARN, not the branch. 
That‚Äôs because CodePipeline zips up your CodeCommit source and drops it into an S3 bucket before CodeBuild runs.
